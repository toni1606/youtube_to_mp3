# youtube_to_mp3
converts youtube videos to .mp3 files adding title and artist metadata
The application consists of 2 scripts. One to download the desired files in an .mp3 format, and the other to rename them and add to them metadata like title and artist. To work you need mutagen and youtube-dl installed. All the downloaded files must be stored inside a music/ folder in your project directory.
